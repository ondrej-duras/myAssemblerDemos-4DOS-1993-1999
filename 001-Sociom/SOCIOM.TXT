
NAME: SOCIOM v.2.0
FILE: SOCIOM.COM

DESCRIPTION:
  Short programm written to simplify some sociometric method
  for teamforming of small military units such as squads, 
  platoons or companies by their superriors.
  Yeah :-) It has been written for military forces, but
  it should be usable somehow in commercial world too.
  Requestors say, the programm  made their method 100x faster 
  in comparison to paperwork.

  How does it work ? Using this program the sociometric method
  still remains manual, but much more visual.
  Program allows you to depict relationships between team members.
  You enter unidirectional relationship of row owner to each
  of column owner.
  Relationships can be positive(+), negative(-) or none( ).
  If positive or negative relationship are mutual, the you will
  see that automaticaly. Positive(#) / Negative(!).

  The result of this method should be an optimal 
  leadership delegation for particular activities of the team.

HISTORICAL:
  I wrote it as a student, during the first semestry at Military Acabemy.
  It was approximatelly at January-February 1996.
  Requestor of that was my platoon commader.
  Since 1993 till 2000 near to everything I wrote in Assmble language.
  That's why this one has been written in assembly language too.

REQUIREMENTS:
  It's a snadalone .COM program.
  It does not need any library or such.
  MS-DOS version 3.30 on IBM-PC-XT 
  with 640kB RAM, the CGA card (80x25ch resolution)
  and some floppy drive should be enough.
  Nativelly it should be able to run up to Windows XP SP2.
  Later/Today it runs within BOSBOX application 
  or on MS-DOS instance in VMware.

COMPILING:
  Originally it has been compiled by TASM.EXE version 2.02
  and linked by TLINK.EXE version 3.0 by following two commands.
  
  TASM.EXE SOCIOM.ASM
  TLINK.EXE SOCIOM.OBJ,SOCIOM.COM /t
  
  Source code SOCIOM.ASM (originally SOCIOM.ASC to distinguish
  source codes of .COM programs from source codes of .EXE ones)
  depends on TEXTY.INC (originally TEXTY.ICP)
  and FILENAME.INC (originally FILENAME.ICP)
  Both .INC files provides user interface .
